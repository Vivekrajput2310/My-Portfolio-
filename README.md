# My-Portfolio
Hello friends, myself Vivek Moya ‚Äî and welcome to my Portfolio Repository!
This is a fully working personal portfolio website. Before you explore it, here are a few things you should know ‚§µÔ∏è

1. Google Form Notice:
There‚Äôs a Google form at the bottom of the page. Sometimes it may show an error. If that happens, please try reloading the page once or twice ‚Äî it usually works after that.

2. iPhone Display Note:
Since this entire website was designed and built using an Android mobile device, it might look slightly misaligned on Apple devices. Especially on iPhones, some containers (content boxes) may appear shifted to the left.

4. Compatibility Info:
While the website works well on both Android and Apple devices, the only minor issue is the container alignment on Apple devices.

Thank you so much for taking the time to visit my portfolio! Your support truly means a lot to me. üòä
